Simple C# app for my learning course.

1. Configure lines in `info.txt`.
- lines 1, 4, 7... are for questions.
- lines 2, 5, 8... are for hints.
- lines 3, 6, 9... are for the answers.

  You can write as many questions, hints and answers as you want, and the program will continue prompting you at random until it runs out of questions to ask.
